## About

This project is my personal portfolio website, designed using **ReactJS** along with the **ThreeJS** library (via React Three Fiber) to bring the interactive 3D model to life. It is built with **Vite** for fast and efficient development.

The design of this website is inspired by the **Flipper Zero** device. As a cybersecurity enthusiast, I couldn't think of a better way to showcase my skills and projects than through a portfolio that reflects my passion for cybersecurity and technology. The entire theme and UI replicate the look and feel of the Flipper Zero device, making it unique and interactive.

## Tech Stack

- **ReactJS**: For building the user interface and handling interactivity.
- **React Three Fiber**: A React library for ThreeJS to render the 3D model of Flipper Zero.
- **Vite**: A fast build tool and development server for a smooth experience.
